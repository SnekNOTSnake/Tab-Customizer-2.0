## Features

This is a basic Chrome Extensions boilerplate to help you write modular and modern Javascript code, load CSS easily and [automatic reload the browser on code changes](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html#automatic-refresh).

This boilerplate is updated with:

- [React 16.13](https://reactjs.org)
- [Webpack 4](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [React Hot Loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader)
- [eslint-config-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-react-app)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

This boilerplate is heavily inspired by and adapted from [https://github.com/samuelsimoes/chrome-extension-webpack-boilerplate](https://github.com/samuelsimoes/chrome-extension-webpack-boilerplate), with additional support for React 16.13 features and Webpack 4.

Please open up an issue to nudge me to keep the npm packages up-to-date. FYI, it takes time to make different packages with different versions work together nicely.
